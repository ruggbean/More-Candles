Seal the barrel, and in time the milk will curdle.<br><br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add salt to the curdled milk and seal the barrel. In time this will create cottage cheese (You can use a bowl to eat the cottage cheese).<br><br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use a piece of linen to remove the cottage cheese from the barrel.  Place the bundle on the ground, and add a stick.  Twist the curd bundle until all the whey is removed. Open the curd bundle, and add 5 salt to the exposed cheese wheel.<br><br><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point you can either place the salted raw cheese wheel on a shelf to cure, or craft it in your grid with a half a liter of liquid beeswax or liquid soywax to turn it into a raw cheese wheel, which will last longer.  Place the salted/waxed cheese wheel on a shelf to cure.  After many days, you will have cheddar cheese!<br><br><strong>Blue Cheese:</strong> To make blue cheese, you must store the raw cheese in a cellar with a very low light level, but yet the cellar must have at least one block open to the outside.",
